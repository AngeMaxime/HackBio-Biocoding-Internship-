HackBio Internship - Leucine Group

Internship Overview
We began our HackBio internship on February 2, 2025. This program focuses on equipping biologists, especially bioinformaticians, with essential programming skills in R and Python.

The internship is structured into four stages, and we are currently completing Stage 0. In this stage, we are learning:

- Introduction to Python and R
- Data Types
- Data Structures

Stage 0 Assignment
As part of our learning, our instructors assigned us a task to create a data structure using either R or Python to represent our team. The data structure must include:

1- Names
2- Slack Username
3- Email
4- Country
5- Hobby
6- Discipline
7- Preferred Programming Language

Our Solution
We chose Python for this task, and implemented our solution using a nested-list (Python script) and present also another solution using a dictionary (First python script) which is a collection of key-value pairs and. Each team memberâ€™s details are stored as a dictionary entry under their respective Member ID (e.g., Member_1, Member_2, etc.).

Code Implementation
Our Python script contains:

- A dictionary named Group_description, storing information about all team members.
- Commands to print individual member details.
- A final command to display all members' information in a single print statement.

Team Members

- TCHOUTANG Ange Maxime (Cameroon) - Preferred Language: R
- OLORI Oghenemaero Oghale (Nigeria) - Preferred Language: Python
- ABDULRAHMAN Olamilekan Raji (Nigeria) - Preferred Language: Python
- SAKSHI Mohta (India) - Preferred Language: Python

This project marks our first step in the HackBio internship, and we look forward to learning and growing in the upcoming stages.
